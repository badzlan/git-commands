# Git Commands

## Git Introduction

### What is Git?
Git is a distributed version control system that helps you track your code changes.
When doing a group project, every developer gets their local repository with full commit history. The commit history makes Git fast, as now a network connection is not needed to create commits or perform diffs between commits

### It is used for:
- Tracking code changes
- Tracking who made changes
- Coding collaboration
