# Git Commands

## Git Introduction

### What is Git?
Git is a distributed version control system that helps you track your code changes.
When doing a group project, every developer gets their local repository with full commit history. The commit history makes Git fast, as now a network connection is not needed to create commits or perform diffs between commits

### It is used for:
- Tracking code changes
- Tracking who made changes
- Coding collaboration

### What does Git do?
- Manage projects with Repositories
- Clone a project to work on a local copy
- Control and track changes with Staging and Committing
- Branch and Merge to allow for work on different parts and versions of a project
- Pull the latest version of the project to a local copy
- Push local updates to the main project
